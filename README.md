# SEDebugger
Inspired by https://github.com/leftler/SE-ModDebugger, but completely rewritten for the new VRage.Scripting system. 

This plugin allows mods to use the **System.Diagnostics.Debugger** class. It also changes script compile settings to DEBUG (i.e. no optimization) level, which makes it easier to step through with a debugger.

When launching Space Engineeers, pass the command line parameter:

    -plugin %PluginPath%\SEDebugger.dll
  
Where `%PluginPath%` is the directory you put the file. So for example if you had the file located at `C:\Mod Debugger\ModDebugger.dll` then you would launch space engineers using the arguments

    -plugin "C:\Mod Debugger\SEDebugger.dll"

Once loaded you will now be able to make calls to System.Diagnostics.Debugger from inside mods and scripts. Included is a `ModDebugger.cs` file which provides a wrapper class that you can safely call with or without the plugin loaded. When the plugin is not loaded, **All** the methods of ModDebugger do nothing and all return false, or a empty string.

To start debugging, from inside your mod at some point call `SEDebugger.Launch()` - this will cause Space Engineers to launch the Just-In-Time Debugger screen. From there you can choose to launch a new instance of Visual Studio or attach to an existing one. You can then call `SEDebugger.Break()` whenever you want to pause the game and inspect things and/or use other typical debugger functionality.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: The debugger will be using files generated by the Space Engineers compiler, breakpoints in your mod code's original files will not work! You must put breakpoints in the temporary files the compiler generated which will be located at the diagnostic output path (see plugin output in SE log for what it is).

Verified working in SE1.189/VS2017/.NET4.6.1
